ft_ping Project

Recreate the `ping` command functionality.

---

General Requirements:
1. Use a Debian VM (>=7.0).
2. Write the project in C with a Makefile (usual rules, recompile only if needed).
3. Handle errors carefully; no crashes allowed (e.g., segmentation faults).
4. Forbidden functions: execve, ping, fcntl, poll, ppoll.
5. Use libc and printf functions.

---

Mandatory Features:
1. Name the executable `ft_ping`.
2. Reference: ping from inetutils-2.0 (ping -V).
3. Manage:
   - IPv4 address/hostname as input.
   - FQDN without DNS resolution in packet return.
   - Flags: -v and -?.

---

Bonus Ideas:
- Additional flags: -f, -l, -n, -w, -W, -p, -r, -s, -T, --ttl, --ip-timestamp.
- No credit if mandatory requirements aren't perfect.

---

Submission:
- Submit via Git repository.
- Test in VM with Linux kernel > 3.14 (based on Debian 7.0).
- Ensure results match inetutils-2.0 output, excluding RTT and reverse DNS resolution.
